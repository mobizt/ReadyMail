## ‚ö†Ô∏è ESP8266 Issues

### üîß Buffer Configuration

ESP8266's `WiFiClientSecure` requires buffer tuning to avoid crashes during SSL connections.

```cpp
ssl_client.setBufferSizes(1024, 1024);
```

This reduces memory usage and enables SSL fragmentation.

### üß† Heap Configuration

Ensure proper MMU settings:

- Arduino IDE:  
  `Tools > MMU: 16KB cache + 48 KB IRAM and 2nd Heap (shared)`
- PlatformIO:  
  ```ini
  build_flags = -D PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CACHE16_IRAM48_SECHEAP_SHARED
  ```

### ‚ö° Power Supply

Use a stable, low-noise power source with short, low-impedance cables to prevent brownouts during SSL handshake.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ESP32 Issues

### üêû Plain Mode Hang (v3.x)

Calling `setPlainStart()` on `WiFiClientSecure` in ESP32 v3.x may cause `connected()` to hang for 30 seconds due to lwIP select bug.

**Workaround:** Avoid using plain mode or wait for upstream fix.

### üî• SSL/Plain Conflict

If `setPlainStart()` is called while still connected in SSL mode, data corruption or unexpected errors may occur.

**Recommendation:** Use SSL mode only unless protocol upgrade is explicitly required.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ESP_SSLClient Issues

### üß† Memory Allocation Failures

On devices like Renesas (UNO R4 WiFi) or SAMD (MKR WiFi 1010), TLS handshake may fail due to limited RAM.

**Solution:**

```cpp
ssl_client.setBufferSizes(1024, 1024);
```

Also ensure:

```cpp
ssl_client.setClient(&basic_client);
ssl_client.setInsecure();
```

### üê¢ Compilation Slowness

Due to BearSSL's large C codebase, compilation may be slow in Arduino IDE. Consider disabling antivirus interference or using PlatformIO.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMAP Response Parsing

### üß© Chunked Header Limitations

Some IMAP servers report incorrect decoded sizes for `text/plain` and `text/html`, causing `fileSize = 0`.

**Impact:** Progress tracking and chunk indexing may be unreliable.

**Recommendation:** Use `fileChunk().isComplete` to detect final chunk and avoid relying on `fileSize`.

### üß† Memory Constraints

Parsing large multi-line IMAP responses may fail on low-RAM devices. Consider using `WiFiSSLClient` or limiting fetch size.
